# Automatic-Wifi-Turntable-with-Esp8266
This is a simple ultra low cost automation for turntables using an Esp8266, Blynk and 28BYJ-48 stepper motor! It uses a mobile phone combined with an Esp to take a set number of photos per revolution.

## Getting Started

To get started with this turntable youll need the following

## Software
```
  - Arduino IDE
  - Blynk Library https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/tag/v0.4.8

  ```
  
## Hardware
```
  - Esp8266
  - 28Byj-48 Stepper Motor
  - Unipolar stepper motor driver (Or a bipolar one, you have to disconnet the red wire, in this example i used the ULN2003 driver)
  - 3.5 mm male headphone connetor with microphone pin (4-pin)
